Welcome to the Unity Neural Network repository! This tool is crafted with the aim to facilitate the visualization of neural networks in an interactive and intuitive manner. Leveraging the powerful Unity 3D engine, it serves as a bridge between the complex world of neural networks and individuals keen on understanding or presenting them in a visually engaging way.

Features

  -Dynamic Visualization: Visualize the intricate structures of neural networks with dynamic 3D representations.

  -Interactivity: Interact with the neural network, manipulate nodes, and observe the changes in real-time.

  -Modular Design: Easy to extend and integrate with other Unity projects or neural network frameworks.

  -Educational Tool: A great resource for educators to elucidate the concepts of neural networks in classrooms or online tutorials.

  -Open-Source: Contribute to the project and be a part of a community aiming to make neural network education more accessible.

It contain a simple example were it can identify the color from a RGB value(Somethimes it not match exacly the color on the output because the nature of mixing colors, but the loss optimization is working correctly), feel free to train it with other data!
